# Let me tell you about [ROCKS](https://wax.bloks.io/tokens/ROCKS-wax-digdougrocks).

**Go outside and pick up a rock, you now have a rock.**

That's pretty much ROCKS tokenomics, too. Anyone can go to [DigDoug.rocks](https://digdoug.rocks) to play as Doug and collect ROCKS, which are free, just like IRL, and requires little effort.

> It's one click, one ROCKS.

# Rocks are Everywhere
There's roughly 1 Trillion ROCKS to mine. One trillion ROCKS, one trillion clicks. It may take the whole world to mine all these rocks!! 

## Rocks are Heavy
We'll do our best to one-up bots by limiting hourly clicks, active hours per day, IP addresses, and more. 
 
# Crystals are Rare 
Smashing a ROCKS has a very slim (~1%) chance to get any NFT, and much smaller chance to get a Legendary or Epic NFT.

## More hands make light work
> The whole world is working together to mine ROCKS. 

Game progress is shared by everyone, measured by the # of ROCKS mined. 

Along the way, milestones will mark mark the journey with an update on Doug, and a new release of available crystal NFTs. (this also creates an incentive to hold ROCKS, as the more NFTs will be available t after the game completes)


> Once all ROCKS are mined, the game completes, and we all find out the conclusion of Doug's story. 

# Actual Tokenomics Here

## Max Supply = 999,999,999,999 [ROCKS](https://wax.bloks.io/tokens/ROCKS-wax-digdougrocks)

## ROCKS distribution
99% (~990b) - In-dapp rewards
1%  (~10b) - Founder + Expenses + non-profit donations


## We're sellin' ROCKS
No profit will be pocketed from ROCKS sales, but we will be reserving, sending, and selling ROCKS to pay for development (including to the founder). Any leftover funds will be donated to non profits and used to support Earth-forward blockchain projects. 


## Slippery Rocks
We're not planning to publish ROCKS movement justifications / team spending, and reserve the right to do whatever we feel is best with our 1% pile. You can find all of our transactions on our WAX accounts always, forever. 


# Support Rocks
You can support this project pre-release by buying ROCKS on ALCOR. Please keep in mind we are literally giving away ROCKS in the app when it comes out, so if you still want to help and buy up some from us pre-release, Big Thanks. It will help this game be made faster, and way way better.

# Buildonomics 
This is a side project for the founder ([cXc](https://cXc.world) is my main), and if you're a dev and would like to help (We'll be using Vuejs on the front end, NodeJs / Postgres on the backend, Bree for scheduling) or an artist (we need in-game art) please contact me (@godsolislove on Telegram) and be willing to take payment in ROCKS. *This is a collaborative dapp, let's collab.*
